     Each card will have its own value that raises the total score to a certain amount. 
     Each of the cards from 1 to 10 have a score of 1 to 10 respectively.
     The card 'A' has a score of 11 and each of the cards 'J', 'Q' and 'K' will be counted as 10.
     Getting a total score of 21 will make you hit the Blackjack.
     You can draw new cards one by one until you hit the Blackjack.
     If your score exceeded 21 then you're out of the game. </p>
